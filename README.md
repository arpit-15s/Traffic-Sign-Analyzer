# Traffic-Sign-Analyzer

This is a console application that aim to detect the **traffic signs** encontered in camera. <br>
This project is built using keras and openCV libraries.

### Introduction

This is a Convolutional neural network based approach over traditional model. This system approaches the problem by employing 3 layered neural network and passing the preprocessed images in them through pipeline. 

### What to expect?

The model should detect and process the traffic signs of 43 different classes. <br>
It should return the class and name of the input (traffic sign) provided.


### Project Setup

Images are 32 (width) x 32 (height) x 3 (RGB color channels).<br>
Training set is composed of 22271 images.<br>
Validation set is composed of 5568 images.<br>
Test set is composed of 6960 images. <br>
There are 43 classes (e.g. Speed Limit 20km/h, No entry, Bumpy road, etc.). <br>
